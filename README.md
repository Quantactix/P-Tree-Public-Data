# P-Tree-Public-Data
This folder is to share the test assets and factors generated by Panel Trees in paper "Growing the Efficient Frontier on Panel Trees."

# More Notes

If you want to use PTree test assets, (1) Folder [Train_1981_2020]](Train_1981_2020) is recommended. 

If you do need in-sample and out-of-sample analyses, we provide (2) Folder [Train_1981_2000_Test_2001_2020](Train_1981_2000_Test_2001_2020) and (3) Folder [Train_2001_2020_Test_1981_2000](Train_2001_2020_Test_1981_2000).

The returns of test assets are in excess of the risk-free rate.

# Folders

There are three folders for different train-test schemes:

(1) Folder "Train_1981_2020" trains over 40 years from 1981 to 2020. "factors.csv" contains 20 factors. The remaining files are the returns of test assets of 20 boosted PTrees, where each PTree generates 10 test assets.

(2) Folder "Train_1981_2000_Test_2001_2020" trains over 20 years from 1981 to 2000 and test over 20 years from 2001 to 2020. The test sample data are named "*_test.csv".

(3) Folder "Train_2001_2020_Test_1981_2000" trains over 20 years from 2001 to 2020 and test over 20 years from 1981 to 2000. The test sample data are named "*_test.csv".
